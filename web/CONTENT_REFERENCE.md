## 🌍 Translation Notes

If translating to other languages:

1. **Keep CTAs short** - Button text should be concise
2. **Maintain tone** - Professional but approachable
3. **Localize examples** - Adapt use cases to local markets
4. **Check length** - Some languages are longer (German) or shorter (Chinese)
5. **Test responsiveness** - Longer text may break layouts
